# Flight Price Prediction Using Neural Networks  

## Project Description  
Flight prices fluctuate due to multiple factors including airline demand, booking time and route popularity. Predicting flight prices can help travelers make informed booking decisions.  

This project aims to develop a **deep learning model** to predict flight ticket prices based on historical data. I will compare different neural network approaches:    

I will evaluate these models on price prediction accuracy and explore key factors affecting airfare fluctuations, such as travel distance, departure time, and airline choices.

## What Does Success Look Like?  
A successful project will:  
- Train at least one **neural network model** for flight price prediction.  
- Compare performance with other models such as regression.  
- Identify the most important features affecting flight prices.
